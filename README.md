# Claude Code Dev Studio

**A full-stack development studio for building anything.**
Web, mobile, SaaS, API, game, content, research — bring an idea, the studio handles the rest.

## Why This Exists

Most Claude Code setups are a single CLAUDE.md file with some instructions.
This studio gives Claude Code the structure of a real development team —
37 specialized agents, a guided onboarding sequence that takes any idea
from one sentence to a configured project, and a sprint system that
keeps builds disciplined from start to launch.

You bring the idea. The studio handles the rest.

## Start Here

```bash
# Scaffold a fresh project (no git history to strip)
npx degit marko-builds/Claude-Code-Dev-Studio my-project
cd my-project && git init

# Open Claude Code
claude

# That's it. The studio takes it from here.
/start
```

>
> <details><summary>Plain <code>git clone</code> instead</summary>
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/marko-builds/Claude-Code-Dev-Studio my-project
> cd my-project && rm -rf .git && git init
> ```
> </details>

You only need an idea. `/start` interviews you, challenges your concept, detects or builds the right track, produces all project documents, plans your sprints, and hands you a configured project.

**Works for non-developers and experienced engineers alike.**

## What's In Here

### Studio Brain (new)
The `/start` command is now a full orchestration sequence. From raw idea to configured project in one conversation:
1. Identifies whether you're a developer or idea-first founder — adapts accordingly
2. Interviews you about your concept (5-8 questions)
3. Challenges it honestly before writing anything (Go / Refine / Pivot)
4. Detects the right track — or generates a custom one if needed
5. Produces all documents with your approval at each step
6. Plans your full sprint roadmap
7. Hands off with "Sprint 0 starts now"

### Design Phase (new in v3)

Take any idea from one sentence to a dependency-ordered sprint plan
before writing a single line of code.

/design       → Guided ADD authoring — every system, every decision mapped
/map-systems  → Dependency graph — optimal build order, no mid-project blockers  
/design-index → Living decision record — every architectural choice with rationale

Full flow: /start → /design → /map-systems → /sprint-plan → /sprint-start 0

### Three-Tier Agent Hierarchy (37 agents)
```

  design-lead, qa-lead, security-lead, launch-lead, content-lead, game-director

Tier 3: Specialists — Software Track
  frontend-developer, mobile-developer, backend-developer,
  database-architect, auth-specialist, payments-specialist,
  devops-engineer, code-reviewer, accessibility-specialist,
  performance-engineer, documentation-writer

Tier 3: Specialists — Game Dev Track
  game-designer, level-designer, narrative-director,
  unity-developer, godot-developer, unreal-developer,
  gameplay-programmer, ai-programmer, tools-programmer

Tier 3: Specialists — Content & Research
  content-writer, research-analyst
```

### 24 Commands
```
Studio:     /start /concept-review /new-track /dashboard /onboard
Sprints:    /sprint-plan /sprint-start /sprint-end
Building:   /spec /new-project /review /test /refactor /debug
Quality:    /audit /deploy /launch
Knowledge:  /wiki-update /wiki-query /reflect /research /docs /status
```

### Tracks
| Track | Activated for |
|-------|--------------|
| `software` | Web, mobile, SaaS, API, CLI, desktop |
| `game-dev` | Unity, Godot, Unreal, any engine |
| `content` | Prompt libraries, courses, newsletters |
| `research` | Competitive analysis, knowledge bases |
| `custom:[name]` | Dynamically generated for novel types |

### 20 Skills (auto-load by file context)
tdd-workflow, api-design, saas-patterns, mobile-patterns, auth-patterns, security-review, database-patterns, performance, sprint-methodology, concept-validation, launch-strategy, game-design-patterns, unity-patterns, godot-patterns, unreal-patterns, content-production, research-methodology, track-generation, systematic-debugging, two-stage-review

### Karpathy Wiki (project + personal)
Every project gets a `wiki/` directory — persistent, compounding knowledge maintained by `/wiki-update`:
- Architecture decisions with rationale
- Session-by-session log
- Gotchas and discoveries
- Open questions

Personal cross-project learning at `~/.claude/wiki/`:
- Velocity data across all projects
- Recurring patterns and their fixes
- Studio improvement suggestions

### 6 Rescue Prompts
For difficult development moments: `prompts/stuck-on-bug.md`, `scope-creep.md`, `handover.md`, `second-opinion.md`, `fresh-eyes.md`, `reset-session.md`

## Philosophy

**Collaborative, not autonomous.** Every significant action: Question → Options → Decision → Draft → Approval → Execute.

**Idea-first.** You only need an idea. The studio handles classification, tech stack, documents, and sprint planning.

**Prescriptive.** The studio tells you what to build next, in what order, and why — not just gives you tools.

**Compounding.** Sessions build on each other. Projects build on each other. The studio gets smarter about you over time.

---

## Contributing

This studio improves fastest when people who build with it report back. Bug
reports, new agents/skills/tracks, and doc fixes are all welcome — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- **Found a bug or want a feature?** [Open an issue](../../issues/new/choose).
- **Have a "how do I…" or want to show what you built?** [Start a Discussion](../../discussions).
- **Changelog:** [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
